BMI Calculator
This is a simple Python-based Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. It takes in a user's weight and height and calculates their BMI, providing feedback on their health status (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity).

Features
Input weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
Calculates BMI using the standard formula:
BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 
Provides health status based on BMI:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
Handles invalid input and errors (non-numeric or negative values).
